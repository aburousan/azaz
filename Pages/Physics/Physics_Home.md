# What is Physics?
In **Feynman's** terms it is:
> Understanding the nature

An example can be helpful...\\
**Suppose we do not know the rules of chess but are allowed to watch the moves of the players. If we watch the games for a long time (few hundred years!), we may make out some of the rules. With the knowlegde of these rules we may try to understand why a player played a particular move.**

It is exactly what we do in **physics**.

We notice what happens in real world, we study things and then we try to find what are the rules this whole world follows.
This is what ~~~

    PHYSICS
</span>
~~~really is!

To do physics we need two things (mainly):
* Our Imagination.
* Labratory for Experiments.

Now for the first one its fine. But for the second one, I can't do anything. So, we will be using a bit of coding (mostly: **Julia** and **Python**).
